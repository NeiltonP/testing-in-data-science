# Testing in Data Science Tutorial

This repo includes materials for a presentation and hands-on-tutorial introducing Python testing for data science using the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) library. 

The `intro-to-testing-presentation.ipynb` is intended to be rendered as slides, and the `step-by-step-demo-walkthrough.ipynb` is the instructor's guide to leading the attendees through several steps of test driven development from the template file `demo_tdd_intro.py` to the completed version `complete-demo_tdd_intro.py`.
